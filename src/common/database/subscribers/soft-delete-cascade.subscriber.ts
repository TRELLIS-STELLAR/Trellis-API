/**
 * Cascading soft delete (issue #141).
 *
 * `BaseEntity` gives every entity a `@DeleteDateColumn()`, and
 * `BaseRepository.softDelete` sets it. But nothing propagated that to child
 * rows: soft-deleting a `User` left their `RefreshToken`, `SocialAccount`,
 * `GrantfoxToken`, `DeFiPosition`, `Grant` and audit rows live, and reachable
 * by a direct foreign-key query. A soft delete that orphans its children is
 * only a rename of "deleted" — the data is still there, and a query that
 * forgets the `deletedAt IS NULL` filter still returns it.
 *
 * Hard deletes are already handled by the foreign keys, which is why this only
 * concerns soft deletes.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does *not* do:
 *
 *  - It does not guess the child relations. The cascade targets are declared
 *    explicitly below. Inferring them from the metadata would cascade to
 *    tables a soft delete was never meant to touch, and a wrong guess is silent
 *    and destructive.
 *  - It does not run in a transaction it cannot own. A subscriber fires inside
 *    the caller's transaction, so the cascade inherits it: either the parent
 *    soft delete and every child commit together, or neither does. Opening a
 *    separate transaction here would let a child commit survive a parent
 *    rollback, which is the opposite of the atomicity this is for.
