# Sensitive action audit trail

The general audit log (`audit_logs`) records request-level activity. This
module records **business-level** activity: who did what, to which resource,
why, and what changed — for the actions that move value, change access, touch
user data, or alter protocol behaviour.

## Why a separate table

| | `audit_logs` | `sensitive_action_events` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit of record | HTTP request | domain action |
| Written by | request pipeline | the domain service performing the action |
| Retention | 7 years, then purged | **never purged** |
| Integrity | encrypted columns | SHA-256 hash chain |
| Payload | free-form `details` | sanitized `before`/`after` snapshots |

The retention job deletes rows on purpose, which would break a hash chain, so
the tamper-evident trail lives in its own append-only table.

## Covered actions

`SensitiveAction` is the declared catalogue; recording anything else is
rejected, so a new sensitive path cannot be added without an explicit decision
about its scope, whether a reason is mandatory, and whether before/after state
must be captured.

| Scope | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| `authentication` | `auth.login.succeeded`, `auth.login.failed`, `auth.password.changed`, `auth.mfa.reset` |
| `access-control` | `access.role.assigned`, `access.role.revoked`, `access.api-key.revoked`, `access.impersonation.started` |
| `identity` | `identity.user.suspended`, `identity.user.deleted`, `identity.kyc.decision` |
| `treasury` | `treasury.withdrawal.approved`, `treasury.withdrawal.rejected`, `treasury.payout.initiated`, `treasury.wallet.whitelisted` |
| `billing` | `billing.invoice.marked-paid`, `billing.invoice.voided`, `billing.refund.issued`, `billing.credit.adjusted` |
| `reconciliation` | `reconciliation.override`, `reconciliation.invoice.updated` |
| `data-export` | `data.audit.exported`, `data.user.exported` |
| `compliance` | `compliance.retention-hold.placed` |
| `protocol-config` | `config.feature-flag.changed`, `config.emergency-pause.toggled`, `config.contract.upgraded` |

The live list, including which actions require a reason, is served by
`GET /audit-trail/sensitive-actions/catalogue`.

## Recording an event

Call the service **at the domain boundary**, immediately after the action
succeeds (or fails):

```ts
import { SensitiveActionAuditService } from "../audit/sensitive-actions/sensitive-action-audit.service";
import { SensitiveAction } from "../audit/sensitive-actions/sensitive-action.enum";
import { AuditActorType } from "../audit/entities/sensitive-action-event.entity";

constructor(private readonly auditTrail: SensitiveActionAuditService) {}

async assignRole(actor: Actor, userId: string, role: Role) {
  const before = { roles: await this.rolesOf(userId) };
  await this.applyRole(userId, role);

  await this.auditTrail.recordSensitiveAction({
    action: SensitiveAction.ROLE_ASSIGNED,
    actorId: actor.id,
    actorType: AuditActorType.MAINTAINER,
    actorRole: actor.role,
    resourceType: "user",
    resourceId: userId,
    reason: "Support escalation #4471",
    beforeState: before,
    afterState: { roles: [...before.roles, role] },
    ipAddress: actor.ip,
    userAgent: actor.userAgent,
  });
}
```

Recording is deliberately **not** exposed as a write endpoint: only the code
that performs the action can attribute it.

### Rules the service enforces

* the action must exist in the catalogue, otherwise `400`;
* `actorId` is mandatory, otherwise `400`;
* a **reason** is mandatory for actions flagged `reasonRequired` (approvals,
  role changes, exports, config changes), otherwise `400`;
* `before`/`after` snapshots are only stored for actions flagged
  `capturesState`;
* oversized fields are clipped to their column limits, so a verbose caller
  cannot break the write.

## What is *not* stored

`audit-payload.sanitizer.ts` walks every payload before it is persisted and:

* replaces values of secret-looking keys (`secret`, `token`, `password`,
  `authorization`, `api-key`, `privateKey`, `seed`, `mnemonic`, `signature`,
  `cookie`, `session-id`, `otp`, `pin`, `card-number`, `cvv`, `iban`, `ssn`,
  `refresh-token`, `webhook-secret`, …) with `[REDACTED]`;
* records the redacted paths on the event (`redactedPaths`) so reviewers can see
  that a field existed without seeing its value;
* truncates strings over 500 characters, caps depth at 6, arrays at 100 items;
* replaces reference cycles with `[Circular]` and drops non-JSON values.

Add a new pattern to `SENSITIVE_KEY_PATTERN` when a new secret-bearing field is
introduced.

## Integrity

Every event stores `eventHash` (SHA-256 over the recorded fields) and
`previousHash`, forming a chain ordered by the monotonic `sequence` column.
`GET /audit-trail/sensitive-actions/integrity` recomputes the chain and reports
the first broken link:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "verified": 1284,
  "brokenAt": null,
  "reason": "Verified 1284 events ending at sequence 1284",
  "verifiedAt": "2026-09-26T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

An edited, deleted, or reordered row produces `valid: false` with `brokenAt`
pointing at the offending event, which is what makes the trail audit-grade
rather than merely append-only by convention.

## Maintainer API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/audit-trail/sensitive-actions` | Query by actor, action, scope, resource, status, and date range (`page`, `limit` ≤ 500). |
| `GET` | `/audit-trail/sensitive-actions/catalogue` | Covered actions, their scope, and their requirements. |
| `GET` | `/audit-trail/sensitive-actions/integrity` | Verify the hash chain. |
| `GET` | `/audit-trail/sensitive-actions/export` | JSON export (≤ 10,000 rows) with the chain status; the export itself is recorded as `data.audit.exported`. |
| `GET` | `/audit-trail/sensitive-actions/resource/:type/:id` | Full timeline for one resource, oldest first. |

All routes require a JWT **and** the compliance-officer guard.

## Tests

* `audit-payload.sanitizer.spec.ts` — redaction, path reporting, truncation,
  depth/array caps, cycle handling, non-object payloads.
* `sensitive-action-audit.service.spec.ts` — actor attribution and event shape,
  reason enforcement, catalogue enforcement, sanitized snapshots, state
  capture rules, sequence/hash chaining, tamper and deletion detection, query
  filters, pagination, resource history, and export.
